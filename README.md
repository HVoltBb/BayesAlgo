This repository was created with the hope that it may be helpful for someone trying to learn Bayesian computation. I believe that there's only so much you can do through derivation, and most of the recent achievements in Bayesian statistics lies in the computation aspect of this field.

In the following, a partial list of common Bayesian algorithms organized uder sub-headings are provided. More will be added in the future.

_Hidden markov models_

1. Forward-backward algorithm ([R](./R/forward_backward.r))
2. Viterbi algorithm ([R](./R/viterbi.r))
3. Baum-Welch algorithm ([R](./R/baum_welch.r))

## Format

A list of premises and objective(s) of the algorithm are provided at the top of each source file, followed by an implementation of the algorithm with a toy example.
